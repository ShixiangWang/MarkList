# Shixiang's Mark List

This repo is a collection of web resources along my study journey.
It is similar to the repo [getting-started-with-genomics-tools-and-resources](https://github.com/crazyhottommy/getting-started-with-genomics-tools-and-resources) of [Ming Tang](https://github.com/crazyhottommy) but here for my own.

I would be appreciated if you can give me feedback if you find something is uncorrect/outdated/missing.
